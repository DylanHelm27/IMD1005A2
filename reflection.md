Formatting: Images and styles are separated into folders. I used a boilerplate with a header, footer, and main on all pages. I also used a kebab case throughout. 

Styles: reset.css style exit, with general.css and specialized .css folders for all page-exclusive styles

Font Choices: I used 2 different fonts: Inknut Antiqua for titles and PT Sans for paragraphs, as it is easier to read. 

Accessibility:
Focus States: I ensured a hover state for all cards and images, with a colour change on the buttons. For the nav, I had all links increase in size when hovering over them. 

Skip Link:
For the index page, I have a large header image, so i added a skip link based off your skip link in accesibility class there to go straight to content.


Readability: I used the webaim contrast checker and the light mode passed at a contrast ratio of 16.42:1, and dark mode passed with a ratio of 14.81:1. 

Colourblind: Originally I was planning to develop different filters for different forms of colourblindness, so I downloaded the chrome extension given in class, and checked all pages with all filters. However, the pages held up to all forms of colourblindness so I did not see a need to add filters.

Extra Effort: Dark mode that stays persistent on different pages (Thanks again for staying late Max) also using google map iframe and captions on the slideshow. 


GALLERY:
I made the page responsive by having the gallery sqitch from 1, to 2 , to three columns. I also put a border on the images, as well as hover states to ensure visibility and clear active states.

TO-DO:
I wanted to have the cards alternating sides (image and Text vs Text and Image) to add some variety, I also made it responsive by having them stack on top of eachother at a smaller screen size.

As Seen:
I wasn't able to get the slideshow working with multiple resolutions with each image so unfortunatley they only use one image. I am happy with the customization of my arrows, as well as your help with captions helps bring the page together.

Challenges:
The only big challenge i had was with image optimization. It was a struggle as images that had a different rato of width to height than others i didnt quite understand how to create derivative images that were the same shape. 

Future Classes:
I'm excited to learn more about SEO as it came up in my work.
